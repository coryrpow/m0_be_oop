# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt like I could figure out most of the problems, but the final question I had to ask a cohort teammate. I think it felt good to be able to figure most of them out, but still find it hard to ask for help rather than struggle alone.


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I find it hard to get started initially. I tend to start warming up by looking over or adding to my notes, but I find it difficult to jump in to something without at least 15 minutes of getting in the frame of mind. I usually take breaks between segments of assignments or between questions, depending on how I'm feeling at the time.


- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I learned that I know more than I think I do and that part of how I learn is through running the code and making tweaks a little bit at a time. I also want to remember to reach out for help quicker or in more productive ways earlier. I tend to spend too long unproductively struggling alone. I need to work on setting a time where after I hit 30 minutes without an answer, going to ask someone else for help.
